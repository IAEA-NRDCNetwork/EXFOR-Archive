Abstract. Excitation Functions and Forward-Backward Anisotropies Have Been Measured For the 7-Li(P,GAMMA)8-Be Capture Reaction Over the Proton Energy Range E/P = 100 to 1500 KeV, Using a 4-Pi Summing Crystal and Ge(LI) Detectors, Respectively. The Data Show at All Energies the Presence of E1 and M1 Capture Amplitudes Arising from The Direct Capture (DC) Process and the E-Res = 441 and 1030 KeV Resonances, Respectively. Due to the Observed Dc Process, the Present Data Increase Significantly the Reaction Rates [Up to a Factor of 110] Compared to Values Given in the Known Compilation. The Data and Their Analyses Remove the Recent Criticism on Dc Model Calculations, Which had Implied a Significant Reduction In the Extrapolated S(E) Factor For 7-Be(P,GAMMA)8-B And Thus in the Predicted Flux of High-Energy Solar Neutrinos; Thus, the Solar Neutrino Problem is Still With Us."
